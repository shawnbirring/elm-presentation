slide 10 values: 
pay attention to the + and ++ operator
we will mention how this is important later

slide 18 defining types: 
here are a few types that we 
defined in elm, we have ...


slide 19: defining types for functions: 
here we are defining 		
the types for functions					
you guys may notice some
similarities to ocaml and to a prev lab
here we are doing ...

slide 21 inferring types of variables:
here we just have variables 
and we assign them values
and elm will deduce the type of the variable
as you can see we will not get any errors,
only warnings except for the last example 

slide 22 inferring types of functions:
as you can see it is quite similar to the variables
this is because it can deduce the type
beacause of how we use it 
for example, we match the "list" to a [] 
and the n to a number
"what do you guys think will happen if I pass a string into
the add function" 
also why does it say
missing number -> number -> number
